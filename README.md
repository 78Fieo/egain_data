## 📈 What the Data Tells Us

### 🔴 Major Pain Points

Top failed searches indicate content gaps:

1. **"fsa"** (351 times) - FSA information is hard to find
2. **"hsa"** (274 times) - HSA content needs improvement
3. **"lifestyle"** (303 times) - Lifestyle spending account searches failing
4. **"uber"** (246 times) - Transportation benefits unclear
5. **"w9"** (200 times) - Tax form not easily accessible

**Patterns:**
- **Benefits** (1,425 failures) - Benefits information is a major pain point
- **Payroll** (1,184 failures) - Payroll-related content gaps
- **Forms** (978 failures) - Forms are hard to find
- **Technical** (913 failures) - Technical issues/errors

### ✅ What's Working Well

Top performing articles show what users actually need:

1. **Online account login assistance** (51,969 views) 
2. **Getting started with WEX benefits mobile app** (21,308 views)
3. **How to reset your username** (11,915 views)
4. **How to reset your password** (10,348 views)
5. **What documentation is needed for my claim?** (10,185 views)

**Key insight:** Users primarily need help with account access and basic how-to guides.

- Many technical/internal articles
- Spanish language COBRA forms
- Partner-specific guides (PNC, TELUS Health, Mercer)

**Action:** Consider archiving, consolidating, or improving discoverability.
