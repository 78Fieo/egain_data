# Pushing to GitHub

Your local git repository is ready! Follow these steps to push to GitHub:

## Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `kb-insights-dashboard` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "Interactive dashboard for eGain Knowledge Base analysis and optimization"
   - **Public** or **Private**: Choose based on your preference
   - **Do NOT initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (you already have these)

3. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Add Remote and Push

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Use these in your terminal:

```bash
cd "/Users/w441936/Cursor/egain stuff"

# Add the remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kb-insights-dashboard.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify on GitHub

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files uploaded
3. The README_GITHUB.md should display as your project's main description

## Step 4: Optional - Set Up GitHub Pages (for Live Demo)

If you want to host the dashboard online:

1. Go to your repository Settings
2. Scroll to "GitHub Pages"
3. Set Source to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select `main` branch and `/root` folder
5. Save

Your dashboard will be live at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/kb-insights-dashboard/kb_dashboard.html`
